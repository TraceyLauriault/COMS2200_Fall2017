# Course Description

> The collection of data about us starts just before we are born. Data about us are collected when we go to school, enter the labour force, often with the help of unique IDs such as SIN#s. Data are also produced as we go about our daily activities – when we shop, bank, make phone calls, order a taxi, use social media, navigate the city, vote, exercise, and file taxes. Data are also collected as we do exceptional things such as cross international borders, check into hospital, when we commit crimes, at death and even afterward depending on what happens to our bodies, how our families and friends commemorate and remember us and if our actions are archived. We are datafied, and living a dataless life is nearly impossible as is ‘living below the radar’ since we each have a data double that leaves behind data shadows.
 
> In this course we examine what data generated by and about us do, how they are used, who owns them, and if and when linked, filtered through algorithms, search engines or visualized into maps, how they shape actions and material outcomes.

> The course covers a wide range of topics, themes and concepts such as data infrastructures, smart cities, the internet of things (IoT), surveillance and sousveillance, social physics, algorithmic governance, predictive policing, the quantified self, location based services, data collection devices and geodemographics among many others. 

# Course Objectives

The objectives of this course are to:

* Distinguish big data from small data, and to recognize data types;

* Conceptualize data as part of socio-technological and political processes, as a form of discourse and as media;

* Recognize the interconnections between data, their infrastructures, collection and dissemination technologies, software, platforms and how data are produced and used;

* Identify data politics;

* Understand the construction of facts and the framing of the truth.

Any interesting and useful tips? Any useful examples?

 

## Week 2 (Sept. 19) – Crowdsourcing & Digital Humanitarianism

This week we will learn about user generated content (UGC), citizen science, crowdsourcing & volunteered geographic information (VGI). In this lecture we will learn about digital humanitarians and citizenship. Students will learn about data contributors, be they ‘amateurs’ or ‘expert professionals’, the disruption of formal data producing institutions, the OSM platform, and how to add to contribute data to OSM.

**We will also have 2 guests:**
* **Denis Carriere**, a digital humanitarian who will discuss his work in Nepal
* **Els Aelvoet**, a Geomatics expert. 
Denis and Els will also guide us through the crowdsourcing assignment.

**INFOGRAPHIC B – (due Sept. 26)**

> Find 2 infographics.  The infographics can be about concepts, processes, a paper, a story, and should include data, etc.  Cite and share these in the class forum.  In a few words, explain why you selected these, how you found them, why you think they are good, discuss if there room for improvement? What would you do differently or how would you improve them?


**Crowdsourcing 1 – (due Week 3 Sept. 26)**

> You have created you OSM, Mapillary and GitHub accounts and contributed your user names to CULearn.


## Week 3 (Sept. 26) – The Quantified You

In this lecture students learn about the quantified self and how the sensors they wear and/or carry in their pockets and/or are embedded in their bodies collect data about them. Students will examine an array of self-tracking data collection devices, why people quantify themselves and how their knowledge and understanding of themselves changes as a result. Students will also learn about personal story telling with data, the process of lifelogging, how the data one collects about oneself are shared with third parties with or without one’s consent. The following concepts will be discussed: quantified self, dataism, data shadows, data doubles, data doppleganger, cyborgs, biosensing, data privacy, data rights, data ownership and terms of use.

> You have taken 20 photos with the Mapillary app and you have contributed the 20 Mapillary photo keys to CULearn.


## Week 4 (Oct.3) – Counting You

In this lecture students learn about some of the infrastructures and institutions dedicated to counting them. They will discover why they matter to the nation and government administrations. They will begin to see the social shaping qualities of data and maps, and how they are part of social, technical and geographical imaginaries.  The in-class discussion will focus on the Census of Canada with an emphasis on its cancellation of the long-form census in 2010 and its reinstatement in 2016. Concepts such as governmentality, biopolitics, nation building, will be discussed and indicators will be introduced.

## Week 5 (Oct. 10) – Sorting You

This week students learn about the power of classification systems and segmentation techniques.  Students will discover that there may not be ‘natural kinds’ of things but things do get sorted out, and once sorted it is hard to imagine those things in any other way. This will also include an examination of unique identifiers and methods by which data about you is collected in order to situate and put you in your place.

**INFOGRAPHIC G – (due Week 8)**

> Peer Reviewers, review the 2 infographics assigned to you and using the criteria sheet provided.  You can mark up a document in pen and take a picture of it to send to your class mate, or you can edit directly in the document. Be constructive, honest, direct, and provide useful suggestions. Post your peer review document o the CULearn.


**Crowdsourcing 5 – (due Week 8)**

> You have submitted your 2 page reflection document to CULearn. In this document you considered the 3 platforms, the process of capturing data all the way to the posting of your final photo in OSM, you will discuss challenge, insights, things you found enjoyable, provide suggestions on how to improve the process, and etc.. You will express what you learned.  End your reflection by discussing this form of databased citizenship.


## Week 8 (Nov. 7) – Watching You

State institutions are often engaged in surveillance activities.  The Canadian Border Service is one such institution, and airports are a unique assemblage of surveillance technologies, data collection and systems.  Sometimes surveillance is to reduce harm, detect fraud and cheating, and other times it is to monitor behaviour in order to either serve you better or to market to you.  This week students discover concepts such as dataveillance, sousveillance, counterveillance, and surveillance. 

#### Readings:

* Chapter 3: Analyzing Our Data, 33-45

**INFOGRAPHIC H**

> Refine your Infographic based on peer review.


## Week 9 (Nov. 14) – Big Data You

In this lecture, students explore what drives government and the private sector to embrace big data and its practices.  Students study how statistical agencies might use big data for national reporting and we will discuss the implications of doing so. Students will learn to distinguish big data from small data and the characteristics of big data.

#### Readings:

* Siegel, Eric. (2013) The Ensemble Effect: Netflix, Crowdsourcing and Supercharging Prediction.[_Predictive Analytics: The Power to Predict Who will Click, Buy, Lie or Die_](http://catalogue.library.carleton.ca/record=b3850835), New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons. 133-150.

> Submit an image of the revised DRAFT of your infographic to the CULearn FORUM.  Be sure to include some notes about what you modified based on the peer review. Include a few words about what the peer review process taught you.

 

## Week 10 (Nov. 21) – Remembering You

Up to this points students have primarily examined data collected by corporations, the government, or crowdsourced data.  This week students learn about the data collected by researchers, how those data are paid for and what happens to them once collected.  Students will learn about archives and why these remain critical infrastructures in the 21st century big data era.  Student will study data as cultural artefacts, and as historical markers of key social, cultural and political events.

#### Readings:

**INFOGRAPHIC J**

> Polish your infographic and ask for help on the forum if you need it.


## Week 11 (Dec. 5) – Assembling You

This week, students examine an approach to the study big data called an assemblage.  Students will learn to think about data as discourse and as a socio-technological assemblage. This will include defining what big data are, and brief overview of some of the enablers of big data.  This framework will be illustrated with a sports analytics example.

#### Reading:

Kitchin, Rob and Lauriault, Tracey P. (2014) [_Towards Critical Data Studies: Charting and Unpacking Data Assemblages and Their Work._](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2474112 )The Programmable City Working Paper 2; pre-print version of chapter to be published in Eckert, J., Shears, A. and Thatcher, J. (eds) Geoweb and Big Data. University of Nebraska Press.

> SUBMIT INFOGRAPHIC – along with the text. 

## Week 12 (Dec. 9) – Review

It all comes together.  In-class we will examine the knowledge gained in the past 11 weeks and we will use the assemblage framework to guide our understanding of big data and society.  We will also prepare for the final exam.
